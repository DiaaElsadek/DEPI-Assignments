The async/await keywords in C# are used to simplify writing asynchronous code.

async: Marks a method as asynchronous, allowing it to contain await statements and usually returning a Task or Task<T>.

await: Pauses the execution of the method until the awaited asynchronous operation completes, without blocking the main thread.

The main purpose is to make asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, which improves readability and maintainability, while also boosting performance in tasks like database calls, file I/O, or network requests.
