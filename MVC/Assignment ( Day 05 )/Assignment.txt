1️⃣ Difference between Single Page Application (SPA) and Multiple Page Application (MPA)
🔹 Single Page Application (SPA)

Loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app.

Uses frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.

Pros:

Fast and smooth user experience (no full page reload).

Works well for modern, interactive apps.

Cons:

Heavier initial load.

SEO can be harder (though modern frameworks improved this).

👉 Suitable for applications that require high interactivity, like dashboards, social platforms, or web apps with lots of client-side actions.

🔹 Multiple Page Application (MPA)

Every time the user interacts, the server sends a new HTML page.

Built with traditional frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, PHP, Django.

Pros:

Great for SEO (search engines can crawl easily).

Suitable for large websites with lots of content.

Cons:

Slower user experience due to multiple reloads.

More complex state management across pages.

👉 Suitable for applications that are content-heavy, like e-commerce sites, blogs, or portals.

🔹 Choosing Between Them for Your Projects

Project 1: E-commerce Website → MPA is better, since SEO and multiple product/category pages are important.

Project 2: Admin Dashboard → SPA is better, since it requires high interactivity, charts, and real-time updates.

Project 3: Blogging/News Platform → MPA is better, because it focuses on content and SEO visibility.

2️⃣ Difference between REST and gRPC
🔹 REST (Representational State Transfer)

Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Data usually exchanged in JSON.

Pros:

Simple, widely adopted, easy to test.

Human-readable (JSON).

Works across browsers and platforms.

Cons:

Slower for high-performance scenarios (JSON parsing overhead).

Not ideal for real-time communication.

👉 REST is best for public APIs, web services, and integrations where simplicity and compatibility matter.

🔹 gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

Uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers (binary format) for communication.

Very fast and efficient, suitable for microservices.

Pros:

High performance (faster than REST).

Built-in support for bi-directional streaming.

Cons:

Harder to debug (binary format not human-readable).

Limited browser support (needs extra setup).

👉 gRPC is best for microservices communication and real-time applications where performance is critical.

✅ Quick Summary:

SPA → For interactive apps (Admin dashboard).

MPA → For SEO/content-heavy apps (E-commerce, Blogs).

REST → Simplicity and compatibility (public APIs).

gRPC → High performance, streaming (microservices).
